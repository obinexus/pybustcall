- [ ] Establish baseline unit test framework structure

# Phase 1.2: POC Development
- [ ] Implement BustcallClient class with basic delegation logic
- [ ] Create mock daemon endpoint for testing

## Dual-Axis Validation Matrix

| Gate Phase | Open Criteria | Close Criteria | Success Metrics |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Research | Architecture + Math Foundation | POC + Test Framework | Technical feasibility proven |
| Implementation | Code Complete + Testing | MVP + Fault Tolerance | Functional delegation achieved |
| Integration | Cross-System + Performance | Production Ready + Security | System integration validated |
| Release | Deployment Ready + Documentation | Production Success + Monitoring | 0.1.0-alpha release complete |

This structured approach ensures systematic progression through each waterfall gate with clear validation criteria for both opening and closing each phase, maintaining adherence to OBINexus governance policies and technical excellence standards.
